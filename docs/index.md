# AQUARIUM - Accurate QUAntification of Rnas with cIrcUlar isoforMs

## Introduction

AQUARIUM(Accurate QUAntification of Rnas with cIrcUlar isoforMs) is a bioinformatics analysis pipe line for circular RNA sequencing data.

By writing a single configuration file, This pipeline can perform the detection and quantification of circular RNA. In the Quantification results of this tool, the relative expression abundunce of circular and linear RNAs are unified under the same standard.

This avoids the need to introduce other parameters to describe the expression of cyclic RNA in other count-based circular RNA quantification tools.
